the definition of Alternate Current 
i = I sin wt
di/dt = Iw cos wt

the definition of Alternating Voltage
v = V cos wt
dv/dt = -Vw sin wt


the AC impedance, resistance as Inductance
v = L di/dt
V cos wt = L di/dt = L (Iw cos wt) = wLI cos wt
V = wLI (voltage is forward phase to current)
V/I = wL = XL
therefore XL = wL


the AC impedance, resistance as Capacitance
Q = Cv = CV cos wt
dQ = i dt
i = dQ / dt
I sin wt = dQ/dt = C dv/dt = -wCV sin wt
I = -C Vw (current is backward phase from voltage)
-1/wC = V/I = XC
therefore XC = -1/wC
